"Custom-GUI-Music-Player" 

In this project, I've been researching on how to run a music player.
I learned about pygame which is a cross-platform that is set of Python modules designed for writing video games.
However, it can also be used to make a simple music playlist.

I'm a big Porter Robinson fan whom is my favorite musician and I want to make a simple music player only for his album called 'Nurture'.
I will include all of the bibligraphy, citation and screenshots of buttons, other useful sources that I learned writing program for a music playlist in the code folder.

I will also show screenshots of how I installed pygame on my laptop terminal but make sure you install pygame in your IDE terminal
Such as mine, I use VScode: pip install --upgrade pygame
